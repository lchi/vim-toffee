vim-toffee
==========================================

A vim plugin for toffee templates, a project by Chris Coyne.  You can find the toffee project [here](https://github.com/malgorithms/toffee).

This package relies on having a coffeescript plugin for vim already - I use my own fork of [vim-coffee-script](https://github.com/lchi/vim-coffee-script) that supports IcedCoffeeScript.
